# Maji Ndogo Water Project: MySQL and Power BI Integration

## Overview
Welcome to the Maji Ndogo Water Project repository, where MySQL and Power BI are utilized to analyze data related to water management and infrastructure. This project combines database management with powerful visualization to derive insights from water project data in Maji Ndogo.

## Project Files
- **Maji Ndogo.pbit**: Power BI template file containing dashboards and reports for visualizing water project data.
- **Maji_Ndogo_agric_survey_data_small.csv**: CSV file containing supplementary data related to the water project.
- **Maji_Ndogo_farm_survey_small.db**: SQLite database file storing core data points and survey results for the water project.
- **README.md**: Detailed documentation providing project overview, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Directory for storing additional datasets or database backups used in the project.
- **reports/**: Contains exported reports or additional documents generated from Power BI for sharing insights externally.
- **README.md**: Comprehensive guide providing an overview of the project, setup instructions, and guidance on utilizing MySQL and Power BI components.

## Setup Instructions
To replicate and extend the Maji Ndogo Water Project locally:
1. Import `Maji_Ndogo_farm_survey_small.db` into your MySQL database management system.
2. Load `Maji Ndogo.pbit` into Power BI Desktop to explore the pre-built dashboards and reports.
3. Access the `Maji_Ndogo_agric_survey_data_small.csv` file for supplementary data analysis if needed.
4. Refer to the `README.md` file and project documentation for detailed instructions on setting up MySQL database connections and navigating Power BI reports.

## Usage
- Utilize Power BI to interactively explore and visualize water project data from Maji Ndogo, focusing on key metrics such as water consumption, distribution patterns, and infrastructure maintenance.
- Integrate SQL queries with Power BI for dynamic data extraction and analysis directly from the MySQL database.
- Export reports from Power BI for sharing insights with stakeholders or incorporating into presentations and reports.
